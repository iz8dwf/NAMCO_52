Namco 52xx custom IC replacement

This daughterboard replaces the 52XX custom IC used for example in Pole
Position as speech generator.
It is implemented with a 44 pin ATMega8515 MCU following the reverse 
engineering information found at http://www.whiterocker.com/blog/namco-52xx.html

I've also checked both the Pole Position schematic and 52xx's ROM and the 
Bosconian schamtic and 52xx ROM. 

WARNING: only tested on Pole Position!!!
If you want to try this replacement on another game contact me first!
